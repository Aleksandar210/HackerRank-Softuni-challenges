CalorieIndex class
it is used for storing the index which presents the clorie index(grams eaten).
Also it stores the indexes with candies eaten(indexes-positions of the original array).
and it prints the array ith index positions from the original one

Main method logic and methods in it
first I input the data in a string an split it in a string array then transfer it to a ArrayList.
I am using an array lit as it is more flexible
in the sugarHigh method i remove the indexes from the list which pass the treshold variable, as they wont be needed.
after that in the for loops I sum the grams in the list until I get a sum which uprases the treshold and when I do that.
I skip an iteration. Which absically means I am aimig to see which elements will not supass it and my goal is to achieve this with more elements from the list.
when I am done with that I remove an elements from the list the first one and I start over until there are no more elements left to sum.
every sum. is stored in an Calorei Index object and in an ArrayList of type Calorei index .
after whih I coompare the elements.
the problem wiht this is that the original array is not taken in consideration and I work on a trimed (the one with removed elemetns).

after that I print the results from the  array with the best results.
